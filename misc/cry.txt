Dear Nayanika,
 
It was nice meeting with you people that day and we will encourage if students of your college engage with us as part of “volunteering for child rights” and the beginning can be with Brain stormer
 
To formalize it, please take note of what we are looking out for
 
a)     profile and no. of participants and the quiz master
b)     date and time and venue of event
c)     CRY needs to be pitched as “Social Initiative Partner”
d)     Our logo cannot be used in your publicity without prior approval
e)     Posters/ Advertisement and online promotional will have our logo
f)       We will have a “information kiosk” at the venue manned by our volunteers
g)     Will like to have a 10 minute session to screen a suitable audio visual on child rights theme- with all the participants presence
h)     If one round of the final round of quiz can be dedicated to “child rights and education”. You can coordinate with the quiz master and CRY provides the question
i)       A complete database of participants with their email IDs and phone numbers
 
 
To make it official, the agreement has to be done in the form of a Terms of Reference, where components need to be
 
-        about your college
-        about Brainstormer
-        nature of partnership (what we is the main expectation: CRY as social initiative partner)
-        What the event coordinating team will provide/ deliver
-        Some clauses added by CRY- to be done by me regarding messaging, logo guidelines etc
 
 
Keep me posted on how you plan to take it ahead
 
 
Best,
Anupama
