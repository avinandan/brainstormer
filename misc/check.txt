Dear Nayanika:
 
I am yet to get the corrected poster. We could have put it up in our blog
 
Please also confirm me the time the event will commence and which will be the time that we need to be there for the set up. The arrangements/ support we will need from your side are:
 
a)     A desk and two chairs (for the CRY corner purpose)

b)     Laptop, Projector, sound system (to screen the audio-visual)- please decide on the best slot during the event when it can be screened

c)     In the beginning and at the time of the final round, the partnership with CRY needs to be duly highlighted/ announced

d)     Guess one round on CR questions is being kept by the quiz master

 
The standard intro on CRY (to be used)- CRY - Child Rights and You (formerly known as Child Relief and You) is an Indian NGO that believes in every child's right to a childhood - to live, learn, grow and play. For over 30 years, CRY and its 200 partner NGOs have worked with parents and communities to ensure Lasting Change in the lives of more than 2,000,000 underprivileged children, across 23 states in India.
 
 
And do let me know the status of participation and media publicity bit. How is it going??
 
 
 
Best,
Anupama
